        Overview: QuestCore Learnhub is a modern, web-based learning management system built with Next.js, designed to facilitate online learning. It allows instructors to create and publish courses, and students to enroll, purchase, and access educational content. The platform supports secure authentication, course management, and payment processing.

        Key Features:

        User Roles:
        Students: Can browse courses, enroll by purchasing courses, and access learning materials. Requires authentication to access payment and enrollment features.
        Instructors: Create, manage, and publish courses. They can set course details like title, description, price, and category.

        Course Structure:
        Courses include a title, description, image, price (in USD, with NGN conversion displayed), publication status, instructor details, and optional category.
        Courses are organized into chapters with video content, text materials, and quizzes.
        Only published courses are visible to students for enrollment.

        Enrollment and Payment:
        Students must be authenticated and have a "student" role to enroll.
        Payment is processed via Paystack, redirecting users to a secure checkout page.
        Prices are shown in USD, with an approximate NGN conversion based on real-time exchange rates (via exchangerate-api.com) or a fallback rate (e.g., 1 USD = 1500 NGN).
        Invalid course IDs or unpublished courses result in error messages.

        User Interface:
        Responsive design with Tailwind CSS (light/dark modes).
        Mobile-friendly interface for learning on the go.
        Course payment page displays course details (title, image, description, instructor, price) and a "Pay Now" button.
        Client-side components (e.g., PaymentClient) handle payment initiation with toast notifications for errors.

        Enrollment Process:
        Students sign in via Sign in page (redirected if not authenticated or not a student).
        Browse available published courses.
        Select a course and navigate to its payment page.
        View course details and price (USD and NGN).
        Click "Pay Now" to initiate payment via Paystack.
        Complete payment on Paystack's secure checkout page.
        Gain access to the course upon successful payment.

        Certificates:
        Students can earn certificates upon course completion.
        Certificates can be shared on professional networks and added to resumes.
        Certificates are industry-recognized credentials that validate skills.
